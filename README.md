# Transfer Learning

This assignment is a part of the Applied ML course of my MSc. Data Science Program at Chennai Mathematical Institute.

## Problem Statement

Assignment 5: due date 16 April 2024
1. Transfer Learning for image data using CNN
    - Download about 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet
    - In a google colab notebook, fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify duck vs chicken and output the classification report

2. Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer
    - Download the sentiment analysis dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset
    - Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify the sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model and print your classification report
